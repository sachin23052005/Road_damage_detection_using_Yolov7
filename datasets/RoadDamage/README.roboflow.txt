The dataset includes 9388 images.
Road-damage are annotated in YOLO v7 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fill (with center crop))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 17 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -40 and +40 degrees
